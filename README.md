# Playground

A mini app using React and JavaAcript for playing Connect4 against the computer. 
Some functionality has been added to enable the computer to look a few moves ahead but it shouldn't be too hard to beat if you try.

To run, clone the directory and in the project directory run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
